# GomokuWeb
A web version of the gomoku game with AI I wrote

Dependencies: Python2, Numpy, Numba, Flask (All comes with Anaconda2)

To run the game server, enter command: ```python run.py```

Then open the website http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser to play!

The player name box determines who plays first, i.e., to let the AI play first, simply put "AI" in "Black" and "You" in "White".
